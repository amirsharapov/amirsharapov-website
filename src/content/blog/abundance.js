# Day in the Life of a Citizen of a World of Abundance

The goal of this write-up is to imagine a world of abundance through the perspective of an individual, with the intention of being the cornerstone for a plan to provide every individual on earth with the means to make this day possible. 

## Day in the Life

### Waking Up

You find yourself waking up in a **temperature-regulated smart bed**. You remove a **smart watch** from your wrist that tracks the quality of quantity of sleep. This was paired with your bed to get the most accurate measurements possible from your nightly sleep.

You being brushing your teeth with your **smart toothbrush** that was charged overnight. You notice your **toothpaste** is running short, so you tell your **smart mirror** to add this to your **shopping list**. You also pick up some **floss** and floss your teeth, afterwards, discarding it into a **trashcan** in your bathroom.

After brushing your teeth, you make your way into a **smart shower**. The shower has predicted your wake up time and accounted for any expected changes to your daily routine, and started **heating the water** beforehand. Once you step into the shower, the water should have turned on, but today it did not.

No problem.

You turn on the water manually. Normally, you pull the **loofa / shower puff** from it's hook, put it under your **soap dispenser**, and wash yourself, but today, you also use the shower's **smart dongle** to mix in soap with your water.

After your shower, you make your way to the **full body** dryer to dry yourself off. It missed some parts, so you pick up a **clean towel** to finish anything the dryer couldn't get.

You choose a pair of **house slippers** to put on out of the several you own.

On your way out, you throw the towel into the **laundry basket** in your room. Your robot will empty it into the **laundry machine** tonight, and do the laundry in a few days.

You open your closet, and choose an outfit out of the several you own.

You make your way down the stairs of your **2-story, 1200 ft<sup>2</sup>** into your kitchen. Your **personal robot**, who is currently acting as your chef, has just finished cooking your breakfast according to your **personalized nutrition plan**, after predicting when you will make your way downstairs.

As you begin to munch down on your **eggs and toast**, your robot strikes up a conversation and goes over the plans you set for that day.

1. Eat breakfast. Today, it's eggs, bacon, toast, and a smoothie.
2. Confirm shopping cart before sending out for automated shipping.
3. Check in with the local government robotic force to see if they need help with anything.
4. Hang out with friends at the bowling alley. You've been getting better and better.
5. Check out the new movies.
6. Read up on the latest discoveries in the fields you are most interested in: neuroscience and biology.
7. Walk in the park to inspire your next artwork after your previous success.
8. Gym.
9. Date night with your girl.

As you slurp the last few mouthfuls of the blueberry smoothie, you go out on a whim and ask your robot to put some ice cream in a bowl for you, just because it can ;).

As you head out, you wave your robot goodbye, knowing it'll handle any outstanding chores for you.

As you step out into your neighborhood, you wave hello to your landlord's robot - currently doing the yardwork and garden. Your neighbor is also out with his robot, admiring the flowers.
