# About Me

Hello! My name is Amir ðŸ‘‹ and I have a keen interest in automation and ML

I started my software engineering journey in 2020, starting with basic HTML / CSS / JS.
Since then, I've been immersed in creating everything from web apps ðŸ’» to ML-powered gaming bots ðŸŽ®ðŸ§ .

The bots were (and still are) my favorite projects!

Currently, I work as a software engineer at PIMCO and
am pursuing a BS in Computer Science at [WGU](https://wgu.edu).
Alongside my studies, I'm tackling a few machine learning projects to sharpen my skills and
explore new technologies.

In my free time, I enjoy keeping up with the latest in AI and ML ðŸ“š.
For a fascinating read on the future of technology, I recommend [Peter Diamandis' "Abundance."](https://www.google.com/search?q=peter+diamandis+abundance)

Thanks for stopping by! Cheers! ðŸ¥‚
